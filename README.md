Pymaceuticals Inc., a burgeoning pharmaceutical company based out of San Diego, specialises in anti-cancer pharmaceuticals. In its most recent efforts, it began screening for potential treatments for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a commonly occurring form of skin cancer.

You've been given access to the complete data from their most recent animal study. In this study, 249 mice identified with SCC tumour growth were treated through a variety of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumour development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticals' drug of interest, Capomulin, versus the other treatment regimens. 
You have been tasked to generate all of the tables and figures needed for the technical report of the study, and a top-level summary of the study results.
